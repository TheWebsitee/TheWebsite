        <p>Here you are going to find the table of contents to easily find what you are looking for that has to do with CSS!</p>
        <toc>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#body">Body</a></li>
                <li><a href="#html">HTML</a></li>
            </ul>
        </toc>
        <h1 id="body">Body</h1>
        <p>Here is the body stuff. There are many different things you can change. So anything you set in this bracket will apply to any text etc in the body bracket in your html.</p>
        <p>So First let's start with <strong>"backround-color"</strong>. This is literally what it says it is. It changes the backround color, for example if your set yours to black your backround will be black. Now this doesn't control the backround color of the whole page. That would be controlled in the html bracket you can find that <a href="#html">Here</a></p>
        <p>Anyways, so here is what the line of code would look like if you were to set your backround to black:</p>
        <section>
            body { <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backround-color: black; <br>
            }
        </section>
        <h2>Font</h2>
        <p>Next up is font family!</p>
        <p>So there are lots of different fonts you can choose. I'll link a great website where you can find fonts <a href="https://fonts.google.com">You can find them here.</a></p>
        <h1 id="html">HTML</h1>
    </body>
